Website to figure out who is most responsible for the time you spend scrolling your timeline.

After toying with this for a minute, I'm not sure it is possible to get the kind of output I want. First off, Twitter rate limits the recent tweets API, so I can't even get my fairly small list of friends data without running into rate limits. Of course, I haven't worked with the Twitter API enough to be sure that I'm not just missing a much better way to get recent tweet count of people I follow. Another issue is that the recent tweet count includes @ mentions of other people that I don't follow (tweets that wouldn't show in my timeline). I really want this to be more of a measurement of how much of an impression they leave on me, which it is not.

Oh well, it was a good experiment to keep me from doing actual work ðŸ˜…
